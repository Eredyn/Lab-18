ERROR LOG:

Upon opening page

	 Parse error: syntax error, unexpected 'return arrow' (T_STRING), expecting ',' or ';' in 	C:\wamp64\www\Lab18\Lab18-ORIGINAL.php on line 123

	Parse error: syntax error, unexpected 'return arrow' (T_STRING), expecting ',' or ';' in 	C:\wamp64\www\Lab18\Lab18-ORIGINAL.php on line 125

	SOLUTION:

	Had to delete incorrect syntax operator and join lines 123 & 124, 125 & 126

Upon loading page

	Notice: Undefined index: add in C:\wamp64\www\Lab18\Lab18-ORIGINAL.php on line 39

	Notice: Undefined index: update in C:\wamp64\www\Lab18\Lab18-ORIGINAL.php on line 53

	Notice: Undefined index: clear in C:\wamp64\www\Lab18\Lab18-ORIGINAL.php on line 68

	SOLUTION:
	
	Needed to ensure that operations weren't trying to grab empty values, added an isset

Upon "Add items to cart" (FIRST TIME PER ITEM)

	Undefined offset: 102 in C:\wamp64\www\Lab18\Lab18-ORIGINAL.php on line 47

	SOLUTION:
	
	Undefined offset, the program is attempting to add a new value to a value that it assumes 	is already established. However, the first time you add a value, there is no initial value 	to add 	the new quantity to, so it results in an error. This can be fixed by creating a 	new if variable preceeding the problem area. 

			if(!isset($_SESSION['cart'][$k])) { 
				$_SESSION['cart'][$k]=0;
			}

Upon "Clear Cart"

	Undefined index: cart in C:\wamp64\www\Lab18\Lab18-PIAT.php on line 139

	SOLUTION:
	
	Had to re-initialize the cart since clear destroyed the session, causing the error.

Upon "Update Cart" (IF CART IS EMPTY)

	Undefined index: u_qty in C:\wamp64\www\Lab18\Lab18-PIAT.php on line 74
	Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in C:\wamp64\www\Lab18\Lab18-PIAT.php on line 74

	SOLUTION:

	Had to ensure that it was not trying to update values that weren't even there. If the
	cart was empty then there was nothing to update, causing an error. Added in an extra
	if statement to determine if u_qty was even set (isset) before allowing it to trigger.
